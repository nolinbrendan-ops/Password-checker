Python Password Checking Project
This simple program asks you to input a password and it will suggest if your password is strong or not.

How to Run
Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
Install Flask if you haven't already:
pip install flask
Run the Flask app:
python Cybersecurity.py
or, if you are using the pre-configured environment:
.venv\Scripts\python.exe Cybersecurity.py
After running, look for a message like:
* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
Open the link (http://127.0.0.1:5000/) in your web browser to use the app.
