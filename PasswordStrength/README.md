This simple program asks you to input a password and it will suggest if your password is strong or not.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Install Flask if you haven't already:
   ```powershell
   pip install flask
   ```
3. Run the Flask app:
   ```powershell
   python Cybersecurity.py
   ```
   or, if you are using the pre-configured environment:
   ```powershell
   .venv\Scripts\python.exe Cybersecurity.py
   ```
4. After running, look for a message like:
   ```
   * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
   ```
5. Open the link (http://127.0.0.1:5000/) in your web browser to use the app.
